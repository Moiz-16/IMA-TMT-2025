# Cointegration in Quantitative Trading Strategies

## Overview

This repository contains the abstract for a talk presented at the IMA TMT 2025 Conference. The presentation explores the statistical property of cointegration and its application in developing quantitative trading strategies.

The core focus is on identifying stable, long-term equilibrium relationships between non-stationary time series and using these insights to inform trading decisions.

## Conference

This talk was delivered at the **IMA TMT 2025 Conference**, an event designed for undergraduate students to present and discuss interesting mathematical topics.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Cointegration:** Understanding long-term equilibrium in non-stationary time series.
- **Mean Reversion:** The tendency of a variable to revert to its long-term average.
- **Engle-Granger Method:** A practical test for identifying cointegration.
- **Pairs Trading:** Strategy development based on trading the 'spread' of cointegrated assets.
